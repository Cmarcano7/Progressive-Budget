# Fitness-Tracker

This project was designed as a homework assignment for MSU's coding bootcamp. 

This application was created with the use of Javascript, Node.js, mongoDb, mongoose, express, html, and css. It has an MVC style directory as well as using MongoDb Atlas as the back end database and Heroku as the deployment server.
